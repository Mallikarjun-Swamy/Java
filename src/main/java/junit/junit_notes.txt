    What is JUnit?

        JUnit is a Java Unit Testing Framework used to test small units of code (methods or classes).
        Simple definition:
                JUnit is a lightweight testing framework that allows developers to write automated tests
                using annotations and assertions.

        Why companies use JUnit?
            To validate code correctness after every change.
            To prevent bugs from reappearing (regression testing).
            To increase confidence before deployments.
            To support TDD (Test Driven Development).

        To integrate with CI tools like:
            Jenkins
            GitHub Actions
            GitLab CI
            Bamboo


    JUnit is an open-source testing framework for Java that is used primarily for writing and running unit tests. Its main purpose is to help developers ensure that individual components (units) of their code, like methods or classes, are functioning correctly in isolation.


    🧐 What is JUnit and How it Works
    What is JUnit?
    JUnit is part of the xUnit family of testing frameworks. It provides a structured, repeatable, and automated way to write tests, which helps in:

    Early Bug Detection: Catching issues as soon as the code is written.

    Automated Regression Testing: Quickly verifying that new code changes don't break existing functionality.

    Test-Driven Development (TDD): It's fundamental to the TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor).

    How it Works
        Test Class: You create a separate Java class (often named *Test.java for the class you are testing)
        containing your test methods.

        Annotations: You use special annotations (like @Test) to mark which methods should be executed as
        tests and to define the test lifecycle (setup/teardown).

        Test Runner: A Test Runner (often integrated into IDEs like IntelliJ or Eclipse, or build tools like
        Maven/Gradle) automatically discovers, executes, and manages the lifecycle of the annotated methods.

        Assertions: Inside the test methods, you use static methods from the Assertions class
        (e.g., assertEquals(), assertTrue()) to compare the actual output of the code under test with the expected output.

        Reporting: The Test Runner provides a report showing which tests Passed and which Failed, providing
        immediate and clear feedback.


    JUnit 5, also known as JUnit Jupiter, is the latest version. It is composed of three modules:
    the JUnit Platform (foundation for running tests), JUnit Jupiter (the programming model and extension API for
    writing tests), and JUnit Vintage (for running older JUnit 3 and 4 tests)

    1. Core Annotations:

        Annotation	                        Description
        @Test	                Marks a method as a test case.
        @DisplayName	        Provides a custom, human-readable name for the test class or method that appears in reports.
        @Disabled	            Used to skip a test class or method during execution. (Like @Ignore in JUnit 4).
        @ParameterizedTest	    Indicates that a method is a test that will be executed multiple times with different arguments provided by a source (like @ValueSource).
        @RepeatedTest	        Indicates that a test should be repeated a specified number of times.

    2. Test Lifecycle Annotations (Setup and Teardown)

        Annotation	                Execution Point	                                        Analogy (Real-World)
        @BeforeAll	    Once, before all test methods in the current class.	            Setting up a lab for the day (e.g., connecting to the database once).
        @AfterAll	    Once, after all test methods in the current class have run.	    Cleaning up the lab at the end of the day (e.g., closing the database connection).
        @BeforeEach	    Before each test method.	                                    Setting up a fresh set of equipment for each experiment (e.g., creating a new object instance).
        @AfterEach	    After each test method.	                                        Disposing of the equipment after each experiment (e.g., resetting state).


    3. Assertions
        Assertions are static methods from the org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions class used to
        verify the actual result against the expected result.
        If an assertion fails, the test method is immediately stopped, and the test is marked as Failed

            Assertion	                                                 Use
        assertEquals(expected, actual)	                    expected == actual
        assertNotEquals(expected, actual)	                expected != actual
        assertTrue(condition)	                            condition is true
        assertFalse(condition)	                            condition is false
        assertThrows(Exception.class, executable)	        verify exception thrown
        assertNull(object)	                                verify null
        assertNotNull(object)	                            verify not null
        assertArrayEquals()	                                compare arrays
        assertIterableEquals()	                            compare lists/sets
        assertTimeout()	                                    verify method completes within time

        Grouped Assertions
                assertAll(
                    () -> assertEquals(10, result),
                    () -> assertNotNull(result)
                );
