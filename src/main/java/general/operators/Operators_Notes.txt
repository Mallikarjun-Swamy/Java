Operators in Java:
    Operators in Java are special symbols used to perform operations
    on variables and values. They form the basis of all computation in Java.

    Java has 8 categories of operators:

            1. Arithmetic Operators
            2. Unary Operators
            3. Assignment Operators
            4. Relational (Comparison) Operators
            5. Logical Operators
            6. Bitwise Operators
            7. Ternary Operator
            8. Type Casting Operator

    1) Arithmetic Operators:
            These are used to perform common mathematical operations.

            Operator	  Name	            Example	                 Description
              +	        Addition	        a + b	                Adds two operands.
              -	        Subtraction	        a - b	                Subtracts the second operand from the first.
              *	        Multiplication	    a * b	                Multiplies two operands.
              /	        Division	        a / b	                Divides the first operand by the second.
              %	        Modulus	            a % b	                Returns the remainder of the division.
              ++	    Increment	        a++ or ++a	            Increases the value of an operand by 1.
              --	    Decrement	        a-- or --a	            Decreases the value of an operand by 1.

    2) Unary Operators: Unary = operation on one operand.

            2.1 Increment / Decrement

                Operator	      Name	            Example	                 Description
                  ++	       Increment	        a++ or ++a	            Increases the value of an operand by 1.
                  --	       Decrement	        a-- or --a	            Decreases the value of an operand by 1.



               Types:
               Pre-increment: ++a
               Post-increment: a++

               Example:
                       int a = 5;
                       System.out.println(++a); // 6 (first increase then print)
                       System.out.println(a++); // 6 (first print then increase)


            2.2 Unary Plus / Minus (+/-)

                    Operator	      Meaning
                      +a	        Positive
                      -a	        Negative value

                    Example:
                        int x = 5;
                        System.out.println(-x);  // -5


            2.3 Logical NOT (!)

                    Used with boolean.
                    Operator	       Meaning	            Example
                       !	        Reverse boolean	      !true = false



    3) Assignment Operators:  These are used to assign a value to a variable.

            Operator           	  Name	                Example	        Equivalent to
               =            Simple Assignment           a = 10          Assigns the value 10 to a.
               +=           Add and Assign              a += 5          a = a + 5
               -=           Subtract and Assign         a -= 5	        a = a - 5
               *=	        Multiply and Assign	        a *= 5	        a = a * 5
               /=	        Divide and Assign	        a /= 5	        a = a / 5
               %=	        Modulus and Assign	        a %= 5	        a = a % 5


    4) Relational (Comparison) Operators:
            These operators compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).

            Operator	         Meaning	            Example
               ==	            Equal to	            a == b
               !=	            Not equal	            a != b
               >	            Greater than	        a > b
               <	            Less than	            a < b
               >=	            Greater or equal	    a >= b
               <=	            Less or equal	        a <= b


    5) Logical Operators:
        These are used to combine multiple boolean expressions
        (results of relational operators). They also return a boolean result.

        Operator	   Meaning	        Example
          &&	      Logical AND	    both must be true
          ||	      Logical OR	    at least one true
           !	      Logical NOT	    reverse


    6) Bitwise Operators : Operate on bits (0s and 1s)
            These operators perform operations directly on the individual bits of integers


            Operator	           Meaning
              &	                 Bitwise AND
              |	                 Bitwise OR
              ^	                 XOR
              ~	                 Bitwise NOT
              <<	             Left shift
              >>	             Right shift
              >>>	             Unsigned right shift

    7) Ternary Operator:
            This is a shortcut for the if-then-else statement.
            It operates on three operands and returns one of two values based on a boolean condition.

            Syntax:
            condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false

            Example:
            int age = 18;
            String msg = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";



    8Types of Cast Operator in Java:

        Java supports two big categories of casting:

        1. Primitive Casting
        2. Reference (Object) Casting

            1. Primitive Casting:
               Primitive casting is used when you convert one primitive data type into another.

                Java allows two types of primitive casting:

                1.1 Widening Casting (Automatic / Implicit) : Converting small type → bigger type

                    Order ->  byte → short → int → long → float → double
                                               ^
                                               |
                                             char

                    Why is it automatic?:
                    Because there is no data loss.

                            Example
                            int a = 10;

                1.2 Narrowing Casting (Manual / Explicit) : Converting bigger type → smaller type

                    Order (size decreasing) :   double → float → long → int → short → byte

                    Why is it NOT automatic?
                    Because data may be lost (overflow, truncation).

                    double d = 10.56;
                    int a = (int) d; // narrowing
                    Result: a = 10 (decimal lost)



            2. Reference (Object) Casting:
                    Reference (object) casting is used when converting one object type to another
                    within the same inheritance hierarchy.

                    You can cast only when there is IS-A relationship.

                    There are two types:
                    Upcasting (Widening Reference Casting)
                    Downcasting (Narrowing Reference Casting)


                    2.1 Upcasting (Parent Reference ← Child Object)

                            This is always safe.

                            Example
                            class Animal { }
                            class Dog extends Animal { }
                            Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting

                            Why safe?
                            Child object always contains parent properties.

                            Use cases:  Polymorphism, Loose coupling, Runtime method overriding

                    2.2 Downcasting (Child Reference ← Parent Reference)

                        This is not automatic and may be unsafe.
                        You MUST explicitly cast.

                        Example
                        Animal a = new Dog(); // upcast
                        Dog d = (Dog) a;      // downcast

                        Dangerous Scenario
                        Animal a = new Animal();
                        Dog d = (Dog) a; //❌ ClassCastException

                        Why dangerous?
                        A pure parent object cannot become a child object.
