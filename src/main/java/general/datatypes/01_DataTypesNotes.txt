        Data Types in Java: -
                Java is a statically typed (Strongly typed) language, which means every variable must be declared with
                a type before using it.

                A Data Types Specifies:
                   1. The type of data to be stored in a variable (example like integer, boolean, floating Point, char etc)
                   2. The Size of the memory allocated for that variable.
                   3. The range of values it can store (like -128 to 127)
                   4. The operations which can be performed on that.

                 Data types used in almost everywhere in programing in java,
                 like in variable declaration, method parameters, method return types, class fields,  conditions and in loops.


            There Mainly two Categories:
                1. Primitive DataType (8 types - byte,short,char,int, float,double,long and boolean)
                2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types. (classes, interfaces, arrays, String, enums, and collections  etc)


            1. Primitive DataType:
                1. Byte:
                    Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 (allocated memory size – 1 byte)
                    Used in low-level data handling, file streams, network protocols, and memory-efficient arrays

                    example:  byte age = 25;

                2. Short:
                    Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 (memory size – 2 bytes)
                    Useful when dealing with large arrays of integers to save memory.

                    example: short temperature = 280;

                3. Int:
                    Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (-2^31 to (2^31)-1) (memory size – 4 bytes)
                    Default choice for integer values in Java applications.

                    Example: int salary = 50000;

                4. Long:
                     Stores very large whole numbers (memory size – 8 bytes), Range roughly ±9,22,33,72,036,85,47,75807(-2^63 to (2^63)-1)
                     Used for large counts like population, timestamps, big IDs

                     example: long population = 8000000000L;

                5. Float:
                      Stores decimal numbers in the range ±3.4 × 10³⁸ (memory size – 4 bytes).
                      Used where memory saving is required and precision beyond 7 digits is not needed.

                      example : float interestRate = 7.25f;

                6. Double:
                       Stores large decimal numbers in the range ±1.7 × 10³⁰⁸ (memory size – 8 bytes)
                       Default for decimal values; used in scientific calculations requiring high precision.

                       example : double pi = 3.141592653589;

                7. Char:
                        Stores a single Unicode character (range: 0 to 65,535) (memory size – 2 bytes), default value null character.
                        Used for characters, symbols, Unicode characters like ₹, emojis (some require surrogate pairs).

                        examples: char grade = 'A';  //65 - decimal Unicode value of A
                                  char rupee = '\u20B9'; // ₹

                8. Boolean:
                        Stores true or false only, by default false;
                        Used in checking conditions.

                        example : boolean isRaining = true;


                Widening and Narrowing (Type Casting):

                1. Widening (Widening is done automatically by the Java compiler.)
                   Widening is the process of converting a value from a smaller data type to a larger data type.
                   This conversion is done automatically by the Java compiler because it is safe and does not
                   cause data loss.

                    Explanation

                    In widening conversion, Java automatically promotes the smaller type into a larger compatible type.
                    Larger data types have a bigger memory size or larger range, so they can safely store
                    any value of the smaller data type.

                    ✔ Example
                    int a = 10;
                    long b = a;     // int → long (widening)
                    float c = b;    // long → float (widening)
                    double d = c;   // float → double (widening)

                    Widening conversion order:
                        byte → short → int → long → float → double
                                        ↑
                                      char

                2. Narrowing Type Conversion (Explicit Conversion)
                    Narrowing is the process of converting a value from a larger data type to a smaller data type.
                    This conversion is not done automatically. You must do it explicitly using a cast,
                    because it may cause data loss, overflow, or precision loss.

                    Explanation:
                    In narrowing conversion, you ask Java to convert a bigger type into a smaller type.
                    Since smaller types have less memory and smaller range, the original value may not fit correctly.
                    Therefore, Java forces the programmer to add a cast to show that you accept the risk.

                    ✔ Example
                    double a = 98.65;
                    int b = (int) a;   // double → int (narrowing)

                    Narrowing conversion order
                    double → float → long → int → short → byte
                                            ↓
                                            char (after 65565 int value, data loss occures)
