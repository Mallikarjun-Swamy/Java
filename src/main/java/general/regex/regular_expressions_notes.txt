📝 Complete Detailed Notes on Regular Expressions (Regex):

       1️⃣ Anchors:
            1. ^ — Start of string
                Purpose: Ensures the match starts at the beginning of the string.
                Use Case: Validating formats, like passwords or emails, so the check starts at the first character.
                Example:   ^A
                            Matches: "Apple" ✅
                            Does not match: "Banana" ❌

            2. $ — End of string
                Purpose: Ensures the match ends at the end of the string.
                Use Case: Ensuring nothing extra exists after the valid pattern.
                Example:  123$
                            Matches: "abc123" ✅
                            Does not match: "123abc" ❌


            3. ^...$ — Entire string match
                Purpose: Combine start and end anchors to force whole string validation.

                Example:  ^[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{2}$
                            Matches: "ABC12" ✅
                            Does not match: "AB12" ❌, "ABC123" ❌


       2️⃣ Character Classes : -> [ ]
               Purpose: Define a set of allowed characters; only one character from the set matches at that position.

               Key Points:
                   [abc] → matches a, b, or c
                   [A-Z] → matches any uppercase letter
                   [a-z] → matches any lowercase letter
                   [0-9] → matches any digit
                   [A-Za-z0-9] → letters or digits

               Negation: [^ ] → matches anything not in the set
                         [^0-9]  # any character except digits


               Examples:
               [aeiou]   # matches any lowercase vowel
               [0-9]{3}  # exactly 3 digits
               [^A-Z]    # any character except uppercase


       3️⃣ Quantifiers: -> {}
                1. {n} — Exact repetitions:
                    Meaning: Match the previous token exactly n times
                    Example: [0-9]{4}    # exactly 4 digits from 0 to 9

                    Matches: 1234 ✅,
                             12 ❌,
                             12345 ❌

                2. {n,} — Minimum repetitions (least n times)
                    Meaning: Match the previous token at least n times (no upper limit)
                    Example: [A-Za-z]{8,}   # 8 or more letters from A to Z or a to z

                    Matches: "AbcDefGh" ✅,
                             "AbcDefGhIJK" ✅

                3. {n,m} — Range of repetitions

                    Meaning: Match at least n, at most m repetitions
                    Example: [0-9]{2,4}  # 2 to 4 digits from 0 to 9

                    Matches: "12" ✅,
                             "123" ✅,
                             "1234" ✅,
                             "1" ❌,
                             "12345" ❌


                4. + — One or more
                    Meaning: Match 1 or more of the previous token
                    Equivalent to {1,}

                    Example: [A-Za-z]+ → "abc", "Hello" ✅

                5. * — Zero or more

                    Meaning: Match 0 or more of the previous token
                    Equivalent to {0,}
                    Example: [0-9]* → "" ✅, "123" ✅

                6. ? — Optional (0 or 1)

                    Meaning: Match 0 or 1 of the previous token
                    Example: a? → "" ✅, "a" ✅

       4️⃣ Grouping and Capturing -> ( )
                Purpose: Treat multiple characters as one unit for quantifiers, alternation, or capturing.

                Examples:
                (abc){2} → "abcabc" ✅
                (hi|hello) → matches "hi" or "hello" ✅

                Capturing: The matched group can be reused or referenced later in code.

       5️⃣ Alternation -> |
                Purpose: “OR” operator. Match either option
                Example: cat|dog
                         Matches: "cat" ✅, "dog" ✅, "cow" ❌

                Works inside groups:  (hi|hello) world
                                    Matches: "hi world" ✅, "hello world" ✅


       6️⃣ Special Characters

           Symbol	   Meaning	                                             Example
           .	       Any single character (except newline)	             a.c → matches "abc", "a1c"
           \d	       Digit [0-9]	                                         \d{3} → 123
           \D	       Non-digit	                                         \D{2} → "ab"
           \w	       Word character                                        [A-Za-z0-9_]	\w+ → "Hello123"
           \W	       Non-word character	                                  \W+ → "!@#"
           \s	       Whitespace	                                          \s → " "
           \S	       Non-whitespace	                                      \S → "A"
           \b	       Word boundary	                                      \bword\b → "word" in "word test"
           \B	       Non-word boundary	                                   "co\Bok" → "cook" ✅
           \	       Escape special character	                                \. → literal dot .



       7️⃣ Lookaheads

            Purpose: Check a condition without consuming characters

            1. Positive Lookahead: (?=...) → must exist
            2. Negative Lookahead: (?!...) → must NOT exist

            Example: Strong password
                     ^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@#$%^&+=!]).{8,}$

                     Explanation:
                     (?=.*[A-Z]) → at least one uppercase
                     (?=.*[a-z]) → at least one lowercase
                     (?=.*\d) → at least one digit
                     (?=.*[@#$%^&+=!]) → at least one special character from the []
                     .{8,} → total length 8 or more (, means more in this case)

                 Important: .* → skip any number of characters until it finds the target

       8️⃣ Step-by-Step Strategy to Build Regex:
                   Decide allowed characters → [ ]
                   Decide min/max repetitions → {}, +, *
                   Decide specific positions → ^ (start), $ (end)
                   Combine groups → ( )
                   Check existence without consuming → (?= )
                   Add OR choices → |
                   Escape special chars → \

       9️⃣ Common Patterns:
                    Email: ^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$
                    Phone (10 digits): ^[6-9][0-9]{9}$
                    Strong Password: ^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@#$%^&+=!])[A-Za-z\d@#$%^&+=!]{8,}$


       Tips for Beginners
                   [ ] → one choice from basket
                   { } → repeat N times
                   ( ) → group things together
                   .* → skip any number of characters
                   (?= ) → check existence (spy)
                   ^ → start
                   $ → end
                   + → one or more
                   * → zero or more
                   ? → optional
